## Installation



## Usage

The usage of this site is to show what I have learned through the entirety of the EdX and University of New Brunswick Full stack software development program.

## Requirements:
    - Use React for the front end.
    - Use GraphQL or REST API with a Node.js and Express.js server.
    - Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM or MySQL/PostgreSQL with Sequelize for the database. (if you choose SQL you will most likely need to use PostgreSQL as that is what Render works with when deploying your app)
    - Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data/REST API methods GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    - Be deployed using Render (with data).
    - Have a polished UI.
    - Be responsive.
    - Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
    - Include authentication (JWT).
    - Protect sensitive API key information on the server.
    - Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, - best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).
    - Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
